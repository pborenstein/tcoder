    the files we have decided to generate are: ['index.html', 'style.css', 'script.js']

    Now that we have a list of files, we need to understand
    what dependencies they share. Please name and briefly
    describe what is shared between the files we are
    generating, including exported variables, data schemas,
    id names of every DOM elements that javascript functions
    will use, message names, and function names. Exclusively
    focus on the names of the shared dependencies, and do
    not add any other explanation.
