This is the log of running the [`randompic.md`](../../randompic.md) prompt.


<style>
.user_prompt { color: blue; background-color: yellow; }
.system_prompt { color: green; }
.file_list { color: blue; background-color: yellow;
height: 100% }
.shared_dependencies {color: purple; }
.filegen_prompt {color:orange}
</style>


```bash
$ modal run --quiet main  --prompt randompic.md
```

The user prompt, the description of what we want, is
pretty specific, giving Tepiton Coder a lot of hints.

<pre style="background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248); height: 66px;"><code class="text"><span class="user_prompt">
A web page that displays a random picture in a pleasing layout.

- The URL to get a new random picture everytime: https://picsum.photos/400/
- You do not need to provide any query parameters
- the id of the img element is 'img'
- the id of the button is 'refresh'
- make the background tomato
- set all listeners in script.js
- set all colors in style.css
- make sure the button shows hover and clicked states
</span></code></pre>

This text is in [`randompic.md`](../../randompic.md).


## The first prompt: get a list of files


The first prompt gets a list of files needed for the program.
The system prompt is a description of what we want. We have to
be very insistent that the response is a python list of strings.

PROMPT:

<pre style="background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248); height: 66px;"><code class="text">
system=>:<span class="system_prompt"> You are an AI developer who is trying to write a program
that will generate code for the user based on their intent.

When given their intent, create a complete, exhaustive list of files
that the user would write to make the program.

only list the filepaths you would write, and return them as a python list of strings.
do not add any other explanation, only return a python list of strings.
It is IMPORTANT that you return ONLY a python list of strings, not a string.</span>

## The second prompt: get a list of shared dependencies

PROMPT:

<pre style="background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248); height: 66px;"><code class="text">system=>:<span class="system_prompt"> You are an AI developer who is trying to write a program

In response to the user's prompt:

    ---
    the app is:<span class="user_prompt"> A web page that displays a random picture in a pleasing layout.

- The URL to get a new random picture everytime: https://picsum.photos/400/
- You do not need to provide any query parameters

    ---

    the files we have decided to generate are: <span class="file_list">['index.html', 'style.css', 'script.js']</span>

    Now that we have a list of files, we need to understand
    what dependencies they share. Please name and briefly
    describe what is shared between the files we are
    generating, including exported variables, data schemas,
    id names of every DOM elements that javascript functions
    will use, message names, and function names. Exclusively
    focus on the names of the shared dependencies, and do
    not add any other explanation.</span>
